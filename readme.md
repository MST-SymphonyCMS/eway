An interface for eWay's Merchant Hosted Payments CVN API. Developers can use this to process payments from custom events.

3. Have a read of the [API](https://github.com/brendo/eway/wiki/API-Reference)

## Credits

Extension is largely based on previous work by Henry Singleton and his Secure Pay extension, I've taken it an applied some paint for Symphony 2.2 and hope to expand to include other eWay API products.
